# Energy-Consumption-Prediction-by-using-Machine-learning-Techaniques
--> Downstream of Data Analysis and Machine learning (Time Series Data Analysis)


### About the project abstract:
The maximum Population and Industrial sectors are responsible for huge amount of energy consumption.This research project is aimed to predict the total amount of energy consumption from last 10 years using machine learning techniques. I used supervised learning on “Smart meter in London” from Kaggle. The emphasis of this project is to create regression models which can be further used on downstream of Machine learning task. The secondary aim is to create the visualization and compare which parameters are responsible for maximum energy consumption. For supervised learning, we found the important model parameters like R² (Accuracy of model) and Error types by mathematical equation and apply for model validation for training and testing set.
