# Energy-Consumption-Prediction-by-using-Machine-learning-Techaniques
The emphasis of this project is to create regression models which can be further used on downstream of Machine learning task.  The secondary aim is to create the visualization and compare which parameters are responsible for maximum energy consumption.
